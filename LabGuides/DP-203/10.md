# Task: CI/CD Code Scanning
---

In this task, we will simulate part of a CI/CD pipeline where developers commit code to a GitHub repository. The Wiz GitHub Connector is able to scan for IaC misconfigurations, Vulnerabilities, and Secrets in committed codes.

## Commit misconfigured code and secret to repository

1. In your newly create GitHub repository, click on **Add file > Create new file**

   <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="322" img src="pics/create_file.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Copy the contents from the block below and paste in the new file. Name it `Dockerfile`

      <div style="margin-right: 150px;">
         ```
        FROM ubuntu:16.04
        RUN mkdir -p /home/lab/.aws/
        COPY awssecret.json /home/lab/.aws/credentials
        RUN apt-get update && \
            apt-get install -y apache2=2.4.18-2ubuntu3.17
        EXPOSE 80
        CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
          ```
      </div>

1. Click on **Commit changes...**

1. In the *Proposed changes* pop-up select **Create a new branch..** and give it the name `task1`. 

   <p align="left">
      <img width="350" height="390" img src="pics/propose_changes.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Click on **Propose changes**

1. Add a new file to the same branch by selecting **< > Code**, then changing the branch to `task1`.

   <p align="left">
      <img width="350" height="353" img src="pics/switch_branch.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Once in the `task1` branch, click on **Add file > Create new file**.

1. Copy the contents from the block below and paste in the new file. Name it `awssecret.json`

      <div style="margin-right: 150px;">

        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = AKIA6KJQR5EGTCVYCLKE
        aws_secret_access_key = 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
    
      </div>

1. Click on **Commit changes...**.

1. In the *Proposed changes* pop-up select **Commit directly to the *task1* branch**. Click on **Commit changes**.

1. Now lets create a Pull Request (PR), to move our new files into the `main` branch, which is in our case the production branch. You can click on the **Compare & pull request** button or go to the **Pull requests** menu and create a new PR, both will lead to the same *Open a pull request* workflow.

1. On the *Open a pull request* page, click on **Create pull request**.

   <p align="left">
      <img width="500" height="376" img src="pics/create_pr.png"/>
      </p> 

1. In the Pull request commit conversation page, you will see the Wiz checks in action, and as result you should see the `Wiz IaC Scanner` and `Wiz Secret Scanner` failed.

   <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="274" img src="pics/check_fail.png"/>
      </p> 

Before addressing the issues found by the scans, lets look into what Wiz collects and shows in the portal.

## Analyze scan results in Wiz

1. In the Wiz portal, navigate to **Reports > Version Control Scans**.

1. Find your triggered scan. On the `Repository` column, look for your <github_user>/<repo_name>. Or you can use the *Repository* filter.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="680" height="176" img src="pics/repo_scans.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Open the details of your scan, lets look into some of the information provided.

    - **Event Properties** shows basic details of the scan, including the overall severity and trigger type (Pull Request or Scheduled)
    - **CI/CD Scan** shows the scan result and the number of findings per severity.
    - **Properties** shows the scan duration and time, and most importantly, what scan policies are enabled at the connector level.

        <p align="left">
          <img width="750" height="573" img src="pics/cicd_scan1.png"/>
          </p> 

1. Now lets look at the details of the **Pull Request Properties** section:

    - This section shows who committed the code (**Author**), the branch name (**Title**), the base and committed hashes (**Base Commit Ref** and **Head Commit Ref**), number of commits in the PR, number of files added, and the PR url.

        <p align="left">
          <img width="750" height="161" img src="pics/cicd_scan2.png"/>
          </p> 


1. The **Contains Configuration Findings** and **Secret Instances** sections show the IaC misconfiguration and secret findings respectively. 

    - We will address the problems in the next step, but you can see Wiz found 4 configuration findings, with one being of High severity.

       <p align="left">
         <img width="750" height="323" img src="pics/cicd_scan3.png"/>
         </p> 


## Address code commit issues

1. Back at your Github's PR page, within the check step, find the `Wiz IaC Scanner` line and click on **Details**.

   <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="274" img src="pics/check_fail.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Here you will see the High severity finding within the `Dockerfile` file. 

    `The 'Dockerfile' should contain the 'USER' instruction`

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="328" img src="pics/iac_scan_detail.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Find the link to `Wiz Secret Scanner` and click on it.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="350" height="167" img src="pics/wiz_secret.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Here you will see the Secret finding, where we committed an AWS Access/Secret Key pair within our code.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="306" img src="pics/secret_scan_detail.png"/>
      </p> 

    In a production scenario, you would not want to add Access/Secret Keys inside your code. This is extremely dangerous, and can lead to compromise and priviledge escalation. There are alternatives like using an AWS role attached to the instances running the containers/application. 
    
    As part of this lab, we will fix the Dockerfile problem, but leave the secret. We want to show that it's possible to bypass the PR checks (although not recommended)

1. From the PR's Checks page, navigate to **< > Code**.

1. Change your branch to `task1`.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="400" height="405" img src="pics/switch_branch.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Open the `Dockerfile` file.

1. Update the file to look like the one below. You can copy and paste if you wish.

      <div style="margin-right: 150px;">

        FROM ubuntu:16.04
        RUN mkdir -p /home/se/.aws/ \
            groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser \
            chown -R appuser:appuser /var/www /var/log/apache2 /etc/apache2
        COPY awssecret.json /home/se/.aws/credentials
        RUN apt-get update && \
            apt-get install -y apache2=2.4.18-2ubuntu3.17
        USER appuser
        EXPOSE 80
        HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
          CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
        CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]

    </div>

1. Click on **Commit changes...**. Select **Commit directly to the *task1* branch**. Click on **Commit changes**.

1. Click on **Pull Requests**, then select `Task1`.

1. In the conversation tab, scroll down to the test step. You should see that now the `Wiz IaC Scanner` is in *Neutral* state.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="271" img src="pics/check_neutral.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Click on details, you will see that there are still some checks with severity 'None' (informational). Those are non-blocking and we are OK to continue.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="349" img src="pics/neutral_detail.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Select `Wiz Secret Scanner`, you will still see the check failed, but as discussed earlier, we will ignore the error in this exercise.

1. Go back to the **Conversation** tab of your PR and scroll down to the check step.

1. Click on **Merge without waiting for requirements to be met (bypass branch protections)**, then click on **Merge pull request**.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="272" img src="pics/merge_pr.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Click on **Confirm merge**.

1. Congratulations, your Pull Request is merged! The code is now in the `main` branch, which in our case means "production". 

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="72" img src="pics/pr_merged.png"/>
      </p> 

1. Click on **Delete branch** to delete your merged `task1` branch.

1. Back into the Wiz portal, navigate to **Reports > Version Control Scans**, and find your latest scan. *Tip* use the Repository filter. 

1. Open your latest scan, scroll down to the **Contains Configuration Findings** section. Here you will see only the two informational findings which matches the GitHub scan you've seen earlier.

    <p align="left">
      <img width="650" height="123" img src="pics/cc_findings.png"/>
      </p>
